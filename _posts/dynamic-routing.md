Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that helps you rapidly build responsive, beautiful websites. Instead of writing custom CSS for every element, you compose your UI directly in your HTML or JSX using utility classes.

## Why Tailwind CSS?
- Faster prototyping  
- Easy to maintain  
- Responsive by default  
- Works with React, Next.js, Vue, and more

## Setting Up Tailwind
1. Install via npm or yarn.  
2. Configure the `tailwind.config.js` file.  
3. Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS: `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`.

### Tips
- Use `flex` and `grid` classes for layouts  
- Use `prose` for clean blog typography  
- Combine with dark mode for modern designs
