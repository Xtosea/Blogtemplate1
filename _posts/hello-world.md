Next.js makes it easy to generate pages dynamically while keeping them statically optimized. By combining dynamic routes and static generation, you can create a blog, e-commerce site, or documentation site that loads instantly and ranks well on search engines.

## Why Use Dynamic Routing?
Dynamic routing allows your app to handle multiple URLs with a single page template. For example, a blog can have `/posts/post-slug` pages without manually creating each one.

## How Static Generation Helps
Static generation pre-renders pages at build time, ensuring users receive fully-loaded HTML without waiting for client-side JavaScript.

### Key Takeaways
- Fast page loads  
- SEO-friendly content  
- Easy maintenance  
- Flexible page structures

Using dynamic routing and static generation together gives you the best of both worlds: performance and flexibility.
